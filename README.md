The pop() method removes the last element from an array

The push() method adds a new element to an array (at the end)

The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements

Since JavaScript arrays are objects, elements can be deleted by using the JavaScript operator delete:

The concat() method creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays

The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically

The reverse() method reverses the elements in an array
